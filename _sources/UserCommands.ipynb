    "# User commands\n",
    "\n",
    "We've used the user command `]RunTime` to compare the speed of two otherwise equivalent expressions elsewhere.\n",
    "You may also have encountered [system commands](http://help.dyalog.com/latest/index.htm#Language/System%20Commands/Introduction.htm) like [)save](http://help.dyalog.com/latest/index.htm#Language/System%20Commands/save.htm), [)clear](http://help.dyalog.com/latest/index.htm#Language/System%20Commands/clear.htm) and [)off](http://help.dyalog.com/latest/index.htm#Language/System%20Commands/off.htm). The system commands are an integral part of the interpreter (and have been so for a very long time). That is, for Dyalog APL, they are written in C.\n",
    "\n",
    "System commands are not APL functions, but rather a way to directly interact with the system. Thus, they do not follow APL syntax. Instead, they act more like commands on a command line. That's why they're called commands.\n",
    "Sometimes, this non-syntactic way is really useful tor day-to-day stuff, and you'd want that for your APL code as well. This is where _user commands_ come in. They have exactly the same syntax model as system commands, they just begin with a `]` instead of a `)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only thing built into the interpreter is that whenever it sees a line in the session beginning with ] it takes the rest of that line and calls `⎕SE.UCMD` with the line as a character vector argument. Dyalog APL comes pre-installed with a \"user command processor\", i.e. a function `⎕SE.UCMD` which takes care of the rest. The default user command system is tightly integrated with `SALT`, but you could write your own drop-in, should you with to do so. Dyalog APL also comes loaded with more than 100 pre-defined user commands, some are simple and complex. All are written in APL, and you can change them as you see fit. "
